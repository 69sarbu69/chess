    #topic : I am starting with move generation part
        chessboard is named with 1,2,3...8 in vertical column and a,b...h in horizontal
        and chess convention for moving (e.g. "a6" to "d4")
        if we set "a": 1,"b":2,...,"h":8 in horizontal
        and "1":7, "2":6, ..., "n":(8-n),,..,  "8":0 in vertical
        we can say "a6" = 8 * ("6") + ("a"-1) 
        in this way we can imply index 16 with string "a6"

    #topic: printing board with game state
    flag variable indicates the end of 8th index in 1dimensional board
    when flagged it goes to newline with \n 
    we also show the rank(on leftmost) since goes on decreasing as me move ahead with index
    and also the  file in the end

    #topic: castling and moving
    we first check whether the from and to is a valid index of board then,
        1. for moving to blank space we swap the position
        2. for captures we check if there are pieces in from and to index and it should not be castling
        3.if none of above then
        first check if the move is castling
        (i.e whether the from is king and to is rook,separately for white and black)
        then
            i. check whether king has moved in the kings_movement of gamestate
            ii. check if the places between from and to is blank
            iii. check if the rook to swap has moved in the rooks_movement of gamestate
    NOTE : #######REMAININGS########
    1. since we have castling property so after every move from starting we must 
        update the kings_movement and rooks_movement to 1 if king moves or rooks move respectively
